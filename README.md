# n2m

vibe coded go tool that makes markdown notes from nmap output. only supports nmap -oN format

![a terminal running nmap to scan the top 100 ports of localhost, then generating a markdown file using n2m. there is an obsidian window with the generated file open, with the title "TCP Top 100", and the output of the scan results are placed in a codeblock under the header. underneath this section, there are two headers for the two ports that were detected as open during the scan, with spaces to write notes under each header.](img/example.png)

## install
```
make install
```

## usage
```
n2m [-o output.md] [-header] <nmap-file1> [nmap-file2] ...

Usage:
  -header
        prepend a top-level header with the host's IP address (default: false)
  -o string
        output markdown file (optional)

Example:
  n2m all-tcp.nmap
  n2m -o 10.10.11.174.md all-tcp.nmap top-1000-tcp-script-scan.nmap udp-1000.nmap
  n2m -header -o results.md *.nmap
```

### intended use case

can be used as is but originally intended for use with [notesplz](https://github.com/raffaele-99/notesplz) and [portsplz](https://github.com/raffaele-99/portsplz):
```
$ sudo nmap -Pn -T4 -v -p- <target> -oN tcp-first.nmap
$ sudo nmap -Pn -v -sCV -p $(portsplz tcp-first) <target> -oN tcp-second.nmap
$ sudo nmap -Pn -sU --top-ports 1000 <target> -oN udp-first.nmap
$ n2m *.nmap >> <path_to_notesplz_nmap_file>
```

### cool stuff

scan titles are generated by reading the flags that were passed to nmap
```bash
$ sudo nmap -sM --top-ports 54 -oN 1.nmap localhost
$ sudo nmap -sX --top-ports 42 -oN 2.nmap localhost
$ sudo nmap -sU --top-ports 293 -T5 -oN 3.nmap localhost
$ n2m *.nmap > nmap.md
```

![the generated markdown file is open in obsidian, and shows that for the above scans, n2m has generated the titles "TCP (Maimon) Top 54", "TCP (Xmas) Top 42", and "UDP Top 293"](img/example2.png)
